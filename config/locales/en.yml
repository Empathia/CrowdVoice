    about_message_first: 'CrowdVoice.org is an open source service that tracks voices of protest by curating and contextualizing valuable data, such as eyewitness videos, photos, and reports as a means to facilitate awareness regarding current social justice movements worldwide.'
    about_message_second: 'Despite what is happening today around the world, little hard-research exists for journalists and academics in terms of archives of diverse media reports. CrowdVoice addresses this by curating a wide range of content pulled from across the web on a dedicated page. Content is initially housed in a moderation queue, where it awaits crowdsourced verification.'
    about_message_third: 'As a second step, the platform visually communicates social and political issues through hard facts, statistics, interactive infographics, and timelines, which are organized by tags, specific topics, and relevant citations. These engaging educational resources direct users to an archive of relevant footage and reports. Infographics and interactive timelines are an imperative step in providing a frame of reference to the hundreds of under-reported stories pouring in from across the world, and are crucial to putting together nuanced, comprehensive reports reflecting both hard facts and the human face of the issues.'

    press:
      TechCrunch: 'CrowdVoice is worthy of the attention: a site that aggregates images, videos and links from witnesses of oppression around the world: in the Middle East, but also as far afield as Uganda, North Korea, Kyrgyzstan and Oakland.'
      Mashable: 'CrowdVoice spotlights all content on the web related to campaigns and protests. If one online activist comes across a spare or one-sided post, he can easily supplement information. Furthermore, campaign participants can add anecdotes and first-hand experiences so that others can check in from afar.'
      Wired: "...a better resource for journalists wanting to report on social movements, even ones in countries where they don't speak the appropriate language."
      TheGuardian: "It is a good resource for photos and videos of protests as well as links to news stories and reports"
      BillLiao: 'This is the purpose for which social media was truly born.'
      NinjaMarketing: '...a grassroots network whose mission is to amplify diverse and progressive voices advocating change through digital media, a place where you can see protests taking place in real time. We find it a very useful tool. Beyond learning about what’s happening in the world, this is a place to realize there is discontent in this world and we must fight for honest change.'
      WikiNoticia: '...imagine a website dedicated to "cure" the social protests in different parts of the world, where we can access photos, videos and information? Crowdvoice uses all network resources from different sources and covers these movements to present them in a single platform... We needed a place like this...[and] as a resource for journalists and researchers.'
      PeaceAndConflict: 'A great source for an insightful compilation of citizen perspectives, drawing from traditional news sources, blogs, image galleries, and video clips from protest participants, intellectuals and experts in the field.'
      Idealist: 'Awesome site. The best part? You can subscribe to/follow any article or voice that piques your interest, which means one less excuse that I have to fall behind in my current events. This is a great resource to release unknown stories and empower them to make the change'
      NonprofitOrgs: 'Ideal for activist organizations, CrowdVoice allows organizers to create “Voices” of protest where users can monitor and contribute links, photos, and videos of protests worldwide. It’s a creative, visual way to tell your organization’s stories of protest to your online communities.'
      AllMyFaves: 'A one of a kind world news site... CrowdVoice is a different kind of media; on it you will find great infographics [and] all the Crowdsourcing material that will show you people’s opinions from that conflict, usually served with some chilling testimony and videos of the events. See the whole picture of subjects you thought you have a strong opinion about. Don’t be surprised if it will turn 180 degrees…'
      AshokaPeace: 'Consider Crowdvoice for updates on issues that matter to you.'
      FarhadMohit: 'This is fantastic!'
      ReadWriteWeb: "CrowdVoice allows readers to read, and contribute to, a user-generated, dynamic aggregation of information on a specific topic. Features include a blog widget to funnel contributions to a user's site and the ability to subscribe"
      VisualNews: 'Around the world people are fighting for their rights, protesting their oppressive governments, and uniting to take a stand. It’s inspirational to see stories like these and they give hope to people all over the planet. Now you can find them all in one place.'
      SciDev: 'Internet-based technology and tools are becoming vital elements in the movement towards open government. But with so much information available, and so many different social media platforms, it can be hard to find relevant, reliable information... CrowdVoice.org— run by Mideast Youth — was set up to overcome this obstacle.'
